## Map 1: Conjugate Coastline Map (Fig 1.2)
This map shows the movement in the interhemispheric conjugate image of the Antarctic coastline over time. It demonstrates that this image is drifting over North America, promising new opportunities for citizen science in IPY5.

## Map 2: Magnetic Graticules (Fig. 2.1)
This map shows magnetic graticules (lines of constant magnetic latitude) 

## Map 3: Selected Stations by Year (Fig. 6.2)
This map highlights station attrition over time. Investment in new polar stations is timely; not only are new stations cheaper and more reliable than historically available hardware, but without renewed investment our geospace perception at the poles will wane and disappear.
