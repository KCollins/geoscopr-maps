## Map 1: Conjugate Coastline Map
A magnetic projection of the Antarctic coastline to northern hemisphere for each International Polar Year to date, calculated using AACGMv2. (2024 is used to indicate future investigations, as field projections for 2032 are not yet available at the time of writing.) over the last 100 years, the projection of the coastline moves as Earth’s internally generated magnetic field changes. At present, the space environment over the Antarctic peninsula is magnetically connected to the northeastern USA and eastern Canada, presenting opportunities for coordinated citizen science experiments during IPY5.

## Map 2: Magnetic Graticules
Graticules at ±65° and ±80° magnetic latitude are superimposed on the polar regions, denoting the general area of the auroral oval. While most of the relevant area in the Arctic is covered by the Arctic Ocean and therefore unsuitable for instrument deployments, the overlap of the southern magnetic pole with the Antarctic continent enables high-latitude measurements on land.

## Map 3: Selected Stations by Year 
This map highlights station attrition over time. Investment in new polar stations is timely; not only are new stations cheaper and more reliable than historically available hardware, but without renewed investment our geospace perception at the poles will wane and disappear.
